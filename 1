    just looking for some good conversation that could help better my time in and yours. If you wanna know more… ask away!!

    Common Interests
  </p>
  <strong>Previous Employment</strong>:
  roofing, welding
  eading watching horror movies welding and generally working with my hands
  <p>Since my incarceration I’ve realized that everything happens for a reason and that taking charge of what happens is important – especially when I found myself sentenced to life in prison for a crime...</p>

  Before THIS experience, I had little education and a lot of excuses for the way I lived and when I’d look to the future I always seen more of the past: hustling, gang banging, partying. You can say I was on the road to nowhere (or worse was always
  possible). Then THIS happens.

  <p>THIS was definitely not what I wanted in my life however if I’m honest, I have to admit – THIS is what it took for me to take charge of my life. Now I look to the future and I see me living a meaningful lifestyle: a business owner, financially
    responsible, family oriented.</p>

  <p>As I said, things happen for a reason so my hope is that this isn’t a one time encounter you and I are having and in the coming months and years as we both travel towards our own personaMy name is Josh.l and professional successes, we can be
    friends.</p>

  <p><strong>Things that I love:
    </strong>
    wholesomememes, riding motorcycles, welding and generally working with my hands</p>


  <p><strong>Things I don’t love: liver, Indian food</strong></p>
